This project implements a responsive changelog display component using HTML and CSS, focusing on core layout and positioning techniques. The component presents a timeline of product updates with clear date markers and feature highlights, following a provided mockup structure. Emphasis is placed on creating a visually organized hierarchy through thoughtful spacing, typography, and responsive design principles that adapt seamlessly across different screen sizes.
The implementation practices modern CSS techniques including flexbox for layout control, semantic HTML for accessibility, and relative units for responsive scaling. Developers will gain practical experience structuring timeline components, styling text elements for emphasis, and implementing hover states for interactive elements. The solution prioritizes clean separation of concerns between markup and presentation while allowing for easy customization of colors, fonts, and spacing.
